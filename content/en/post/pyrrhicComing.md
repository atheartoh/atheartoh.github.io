<span class="letterine"><i>T</i>his is the story of painful victory.</span>
<br>
For the three of us in the band as full-time members, it's been a while since creating and publishing music. This has stuck in my craw since shortly after we released our first self-made project, Born From Ashes.

The Absent Soul project is over, but the spirit is not gone, I've talked it to **death**, but I'm ready for the future.
{{< /marginpar >}}
I wish I could say it's been fulfiilling, but part of the fulfillment for me is if there's even space for us to be heard, listened to, and supported. 

The song itself is about the process of fighting for something you believe in, only to have lost something too great for the fight to have been worth it. It's an apt name, and the name came before any lyrics.

## The Writing Process

This is the first song off of something we're unsure of the final result. Could be an EP, could be a full-length. Currently the writing process is slowed most by lyrical contribution. (Thanks to Keigen, our resident songwriter.)

I've been writing a poem to start the lyrical concepts, loosely based around an emotional ideal that Keigen writes into the instrumental, and it's been going very well in terms of my happiness on the lyrical content itself. I'm not satisfied, but I'm definitely at least 60% happy with the outcome.

### What Helps

1. Ordering the shirt that dropped before you read this.
2. Listening to the song and sharing it.
3. Interacting with us online. 

Currently our goal is to offer merch that we produce Dayton local, and we need to have some buy-in from YOU to make that happen. If you've read this up to here, you're already supporting us.

### The Future

Task List:
- [x] Create music
- [x] Get first merch item (available now)
- [ ] Get with local business to create partnerships in merch.
- [ ] Start donating to charity.

The goal is that the support we receive pays to keep the project going, with the goal that we have two places to buy cool things, one that supports the band, and another that supports the charities we believe in that do work in our area. 

We live in uncertain and broken times, and we want to do more than we can afford to help. We want to compel anyone willing and able to represent and support the causes we believe in. Help for the unhoused, LGBTQ+ causes, and community building initiatives are our goal. 

Thanks for reading.
